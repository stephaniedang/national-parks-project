# Adventure Awaits
---
This repository is part of a personal project I've had floating in my head for the last few months. I wanted to create an interactive map to help my own trip planning when it came to finding national parks near my new home. I worked on this through November 2023 to learn and better familiar myself with creating data visualizations in Svelte!

## Data
---
The data used in this visualization was sourced from the National Park Service's data portal and Wikipedia's list of national parks page. Due to drawn map restrictions, the following national parks are not displayed: National Park of American Samoa, Virgin Islands National Park.
